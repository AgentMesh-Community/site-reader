// The process runner's stop notice, and the one sentence a block answers it with.
//
// When a run is stopped, the runner tells every holder with work in flight, in
// a message whose first line is `run <run id> phase <phase>: stop that` (the
// runner's stopMessage, process-runner/scripts/messages.mjs). A block runs its
// job on every message it is sent, so until 2026-09-23 a stop notice was read
// as work: site-reader answered "I need a web address to read", and the runner,
// which by then had a new run of the same phase waiting on site-reader, took
// that answer as the new run's. A stop notice does no work and writes nothing.
// The answer names the run and the phase, so the runner matches it to the run
// that was stopped by its words, even where it cannot match it by id.
//
// The same file in every block, like caller.mjs, because a package carries its
// own files. The master copy is explainer-blocks/shared/stop-notice.mjs.
//
//   needs: node >= 22
